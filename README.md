# Crystal Collector

### About

    This is an interactive game built for web browsers using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

### Player Instructions
    
    To start: Press on a crystal and see if you can determine the value of each crystal. Use the crystals to make your total score match the random number shown to you. 

### Application Overview

    There are four crystals on the page, each with it's own hidden value. When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount to your total score and that will be the value of that crystal until you win or lose. 
    
    There is a randomly generated number at the start of each game and will change every time you win or lose. Use the crystals to make your total score match the random number displayed to you. 
    
    If your total score matches the random number, you win. If you exceed the random number you lose. 
    
    The game automatically restarts whenever you win or loses so you can try again: your score will be reset, you will be given a new random number and each of the crystals will have four new hidden values. 
    
    Play as many times as you want, the game will keep track of how many times you've won or lost.
